# sudoslv
Sudoku solver using backtracking in C. Created to practice some C programming before I take 61C at Berkeley. Sorry for the lame project... this was all I could think of for the time being. I used pointers intentionally to get a feel of pointer concepts better in terms of array manipulation. 

### Getting Started
Run the following command to clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/kyuds/sudoslv.git
```
Use the included *MakeFile* (run `make` in terminal) to compile the program. Please note that for the sake of practice, the solving algorithm was separated into a different header file. For short enough programs, this is not necessary. To run the actual executable, run `./sudoku`.

Sample taken from `sudoku.com/hard`, tested on Mac OS (UNIX).
